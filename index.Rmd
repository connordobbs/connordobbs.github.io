# About Me

My name is Connor Dobbs and I am a current student in SMU's MSDS program. I am based out of Dallas and currently work in Supply Chain Planning and Analytics. 

Hobbies include keeping up with the Data Science field, music (enjoy a wide range and currently learning to play guitar as a COVID quarantining passion project), reading, and watching Liverpool soccer matches.
