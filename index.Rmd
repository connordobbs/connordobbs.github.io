# About Me

### My name is Connor Dobbs and I am a current student in SMU's MSDS program. I am based out of Dallas and currently work in Supply Chain Planning and Analytics. 

### Hobbies include keeping up with the Data Science field, music (enjoy a wide range and currently learning to play guitar as a COVID quarantining passion project), and reading. 

### The other tabs on this website contain examples of my work and analysis. Please check them out and feel free to send any feedback or questions to dobbs@smu.edu!
